# Project Road Map

I am currently using [this](https://github.com/kiteco/python-youtube-code/tree/master/build-hangman-in-python) 
code to help me build my game. 

This code uses a separate python file that only contains a long list of words for the hangman game, using random, to take 
a single word from said list. This code uses all the things that we have learned this semester in this class

I plan to:

- Make 3 levels of difficulties: Easy, Normal, and Hard

These 3 levels will consist of different words based on their difficulty 


# CHECK LIST

- [x] Made the list for easy difficulty
- [x] Made the list for normal difficulty 
- [x] Made the list for hard difficulty
- [ ] Start on the main project file
- [ ] Finish the main game
- [ ] Complete Project Presentation


I hope to complete my game and presentation a day before the due date (Friday, July 30).
