# Project Road Map

I am currently using [THIS](https://github.com/kiteco/python-youtube-code/tree/master/build-hangman-in-python) 
code to help me build my game. it is the code that inspried me to make this project and build a better game off of it

This code uses a separate python file that only contains a long list of words for the hangman game, using random, to take 
a single word from said list. I will adapt from this and make it a little more complex with using multiple files and lists.
the code also has a whole function dedicated to making the caricature of the hangman itself. it only uses dashes and 
slashes to do this. I will be adapting this and making a GUI with Tkinter. This code uses all the things that we have 
learned this semester in this class. I hope to expand my knowledge and programming skills with this project.  

I plan to:

- Make 3 levels of difficulties: Easy, Normal, and Hard

These 3 levels will have a different variety of words ranging from the easiest of 3-letter words to hard, word likely 
you have never heard before.


- Make an interactive GUI with tkinter. 

I have a little prior experience with tkinter, so I want to expand on that knowledge and make a good-looking GUI that 
will help people enjoy my program more. I hope I can accomplish this with great success. The Diffuluclties are finished 
and working properly.

# Progress so far

I will be updating this daily/weekly on my progress

Week of March 29th;

- Created Github repository
- Made the python files with the lists with the different difficulties.
- Created main project files
- Created Easy words python file
- Created Hard words python file
- Added all my files to the repository
- Started creating the game 
- Trouble-shot problems with implementation of the difficulty .py files I made. all boiled down to a simple error in the
import line. since I have never used that before i didn't know what I was doing
- Difficulty selection is working!
