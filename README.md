# Hangman with GUI and Difficulties
A game of hangman with GUI and different difficulties. 

Hello People,

[Here](https://github.com/kiteco/python-youtube-code/tree/master/build-hangman-in-python) is the code I was inspired 
from. I will use this to impliment my ideas and make it a better game 

I plan to:

Make 3 levels of difficulties: Easy, Normal, and Hard

These 3 levels will have a different variety of words ranging from the easiest of 3-letter words to hard, word likely 
you have never heard before.
